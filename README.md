# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This program is designed to replicate the game of tic tac toe! The game will feature the player being able to pick their pieces, make moves on a 3x3 board, and play against an AI! There is error checking to ensure the player is entering a move that is actually on the board and also ensuring that they aren't trying to place a piece on a spot that already exists. The AI plays by counter acting any of your moves when it sees you having 2 out of the 3 spots filled on a specific row. If you do not have a set up like that, then the AI will try and get three in a row by itself.
